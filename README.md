### Shravasti was a city of ancient and one of the six largest cities in India during Gautama Buddha's lifetime. The city is located in the fertile Gangetic plains some 170 km NE of Lucknow. Shravasti rose to fame due to its association with Buddha and Mahavira and became one of the eight holy places of Buddhist pilgrimage. Buddha is said to have spent 24 rainy seasons besides performing the Twin Miracle of emanating fire and water from his body here. Besides, Suhaildev Wildlife Sanctuary provides the perfect nature trail options to tourists and pilgrims alike.

# About The Project
