### Shravasti was a city of ancient and one of the six largest cities in India during Gautama Buddha's lifetime. The city is located in the fertile Gangetic plains some 170 km NE of Lucknow. Shravasti rose to fame due to its association with Buddha and Mahavira and became one of the eight holy places of Buddhist pilgrimage. Buddha is said to have spent 24 rainy seasons besides performing the Twin Miracle of emanating fire and water from his body here. Besides, Suhaildev Wildlife Sanctuary provides the perfect nature trail options to tourists and pilgrims alike.

# About The Project

# challenges to build this website
<h5>1. Communication
Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp.</h5>
<h5>2. Collaboration
As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier. <br> <br>
These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player.</h5>

**These challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player and finally we did the constitution of all the problems together and made our perfect project.**
